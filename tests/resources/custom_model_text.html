In this paragraph we can add completely custom sections and details about a given dataset. Perhaps that it was built based on <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">ChEMBL</a> or something similar.

<h2>We can add tables</h2>

<table border="2">
    <tr>
        <th>Parameter</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Third col</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>C</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>A2</td>
        <td>B2</td>
        <td>C2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
